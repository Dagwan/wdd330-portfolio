This week focuses on how we can manage our codes while 
still writing them to prevent us from having too many bugs. 
It is seen as good practice to write codes that can be understood 
by even a non-programmer. Debugging gives us the opportunity to 
report errors as soon as possible as they occur in our code, 
making our software development process less stress-free. 
More accessible interpretations. Debugging provides us with 
more information about data structures, making it so easier 
to interpret. 

Studies show that Testing and Debugging are important activities 
in software development and are also good practices because 
sometimes we write programs that run with logic, syntax, 
and system errors. Logical are sometimes difficult to 
identify particularly for new programmers because sometimes 
it hard for them to quickly understand what is going on. 

For example, the code below will run but having bug in it. 

function amIOldEnough(myAge){ 
    if (myAge = 12) { 
    alert(myAge);  
    return 'No, sorry.';     
}else if (myAge < 18) { 
    return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';     
}else {  
    return 'Yep, come on in!';     
}} 
amIOldEnough(21);  

The above code is supposed to return a code block in 
lines 28 and 29 because I am passing an argument of (23) 
to the call to function, but it returns a code block in 
lines 23, 24 and 25 because instead of testing for equality 
myAge ===12; I wrong assign 12 as a value of myAge.  

Thank you, Sir.
